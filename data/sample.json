Hardware accelerators such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs) are a promising solution that can satisfy these requirements for both\nembedded and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. In FPGAs, as well as\nCPUs and GPUs, aggressive voltage scaling below the nominal level is an\neffective technique for power dissipation minimization. Unfortunately, bit-flip\nfaults start to appear as the voltage is scaled down closer to the transistor\nthreshold due to timing issues, thus creating a resilience issue.\n  This paper experimentally evaluates the resilience of the training phase of\nDNNs in the presence of voltage underscaling related faults of FPGAs,\nespecially in on-chip memories. Toward this goal, we have experimentally\nevaluated the resilience of LeNet-5 and also a specially designed network for\nCIFAR-10 dataset with different activation functions of Rectified Linear Unit\n(Relu) and Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh). We have found that modern FPGAs are\nrobust enough in extremely low-voltage levels and that low-voltage related\nfaults can be automatically masked within the training iterations, so there is\nno need for costly software- or hardware-oriented fault mitigation techniques\nlike ECC. Approximately 10% more training iterations are needed to fill the gap\nin the accuracy.

Recent discoveries of low\nmass, large radii objects (\"super-puffs\") have challenged theories of planet\nformation and atmospheric loss, as their high inferred gas masses make them\nvulnerable to runaway accretion and hydrodynamic escape. Here we propose that\nhigh altitude photochemical hazes could enhance the observed radii of low-mass\nplanets and explain the nature of super-puffs. We construct model atmospheres\nin radiative-convective equilibrium and compute rates of atmospheric escape and\nhaze distributions, taking into account haze coagulation, sedimentation,\ndiffusion, and advection by an outflow wind. We develop mass-radius diagrams\nthat include atmospheric lifetimes and haze opacity, which is enhanced by the\noutflow, such that young (~0.1-1 Gyr), warm (T$_{eq}$ $\\geq$ 500 K), low mass\nobjects ($M_c$ < 4M$_{\\rm Earth}$) should experience the most apparent radius\nenhancement due to hazes, reaching factors of three. This reconciles the\ndensities and ages of the most extreme super-puffs. For Kepler-51b, the\ninclusion of hazes reduces its inferred gas mass fraction to <10%, similar to\nthat of planets on the large radius side of the sub-Neptune radius gap. This\nsuggests that Kepler-51b may be evolving towards that population, and that some\nwarm sub-Neptunes may have evolved from super-puffs. Hazes also render\ntransmission spectra of super-puffs and sub-Neptunes featureless, consistent\nwith recent measurements. Our hypothesis can be tested by future observations\nof super-puffs' transmission spectra at mid-infrared wavelengths, where we\npredict that the planet radius will be half of that observed in the\nnear-infrared.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["astro-ph.EP"], "versions": ["v1", "v2"]}

First, with limited number of parameters in RNN, it\ncannot model the low-frequency dynamics accurately, thus an extra linear model\nhas been used, which can become an interference for tracking control at high\nfrequencies. Moreover, the control speed and the RNN modeling accuracy cannot\nbe improved simultaneously as the control sampling speed is restricted by the\nlength of the RNN training set.

In this review we briefly introduce the unique\nstructural and electronic features of SACs, which contributes to\ncomprehensively understand the reaction mechanism owing to their structural\nsimplicity and diversity, and in turn expedite the rational design of fantastic\ncatalysts at the atomic scale. Then, we summarize the most recent experimental\nand computational efforts on developing novel SACs with excellent NERR\nperformance, including precious metal-, nonprecious metal- and nonmetal-based\nSACs. Finally, we present challenges and perspectives of SACs on NERR, as well\nas some potential means for advanced NERR catalyst.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.atm-clus"], "versions": ["v1", "v2", "v3", "v4"]}

Indeed, it has been proposed that\nthe observed clumpiness in AGN winds is caused by thermal instability (TI).\nWhile many studies employing time-dependent numerical simulations of AGN\noutflows have included the necessary physics for TI, none have so far managed\nto produce clumpiness. Here we present the first such clumpy wind simulations\nin 1-D and 2-D, obtained by simulating parsec scale outflows irradiated by an\nAGN. By combining an analysis of our extensive parameter survey with physical\narguments, we show that the lack of clumps in previous numerical models can be\nattributed to the following three effects: (i) insufficient radiative heating\nor other physical processes that prevent the outflowing gas from entering the\nTI zone; (ii) the stabilizing effect of tidal stretching in cases where the gas\nenters the TI zone; and (iii) a flow speed effect: in circumstances where\nstretching is inefficient, the flow can still be so fast that it passes through\nthe TI zone too quickly for perturbations to grow. Besides these\nconsiderations, we also find that a necessary criterion to trigger TI in an\noutflow is for the pressure ionization parameter to decrease along a streamline\nonce gas enters a TI zone.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "versions": ["v1"]}

Weight pruning of DNNs is proposed, but existing schemes represent two\nextremes in the design space: non-structured pruning is fine-grained, accurate,\nbut not hardware friendly; structured pruning is coarse-grained,\nhardware-efficient, but with higher accuracy loss.

In this work, we are motivated to investigate the\nLandau-Zenner problem of polariton condensates in a periodic potential under\nnonresonant pumping, considering driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equations\ncoupled to the rate equation of a reservoir. Using a two-mode approach, we find\nfluctuation of the reservoir can be considered as a constant and the relative\nphase plays a very important role.

Recent experiments have shown that when the discriminator is\nprovided with domain information in both domains and label information in the\nsource domain, it is able to preserve the complex multimodal information and\nhigh semantic information in both domains. Following this idea, we adopt a\ndiscriminator with $2K$-dimensional output to perform both domain-level and\nclass-level alignments simultaneously in a single discriminator.

To make cellular MIoT\na reality, data transfer and control procedures specifically designed for the\nsupport of IoT are needed. For this reason, 3GPP has introduced the Control\nPlane Cellular IoT optimization, which foresees a simplified bearer\ninstantiation, with the Mobility Management Entity (MME) handling both control\nand data traffic. The performance of the MME has therefore become critical, and\nproperly scaling its computational capability can determine the ability of the\nwhole network to tackle MIoT effectively. In particular, considering\nvirtualized networks and the need for an efficient allocation of computing\nresources, it is paramount to characterize the MME performance as the MIoT\ntraffic load changes.

In this work, we follow the same strategy to study the case of\nacetaldehyde (CH3CHO). Method: To this end, we used the data obtained with the\nIRAM-NOEMA interferometer in the framework of the Large Program SOLIS to image\nthe B0 and B1 shocks along the L1157 blueshifted outflow in methanol (CH3OH)\nand acetaldehyde line emission. Results: We imaged six CH3OH and eight CH3CHO\nlines which cover upper level energies up to 30 K. Both species trace the B0\nmolecular cavity as well as the northern B1 portion, i.e. the regions where the\nyoungest shocks (1000 yr) occurred. The CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CHO emission peaks\ntowards the B1b clump, where we measured the following column densities and\nrelative abundances: 1.3 x 10^16 cm-2 and 6.5 x 10-6 (methanol), and 7 x 10^13\ncm-2 and 3.5 x 10-8 (acetaldehyde). We carried out a non-LTE LVG analysis of\nthe observed CH3OH line: the average kinetic temperature and density of the\nemitting gas are Tkin = 90 K and nH2 = 4 x 10^5 cm-3, respectively. The CH3OH\nand CH3CHO abundance ratio towards B1b is 190, varying by less than a factor 3\nthroughout the whole B0-B1 structure. Conclusions: The comparison of\nastrochemical model predictions with the observed methanol and acetaldehyde\nspatial distribution does not allow to distinguish whether acetaldehyde is\nformed on the grain mantles or rather on the gas-phase, as its gas-phase\nformation, dominated by the reaction of ethyl radical (CH3CH2) with atomic\noxygen, is very fast.

Despite these efforts, the conjecture in general graphs has remained\nwide open for almost four decades.\n  In this paper, we provide a proof of a non-trivial consequence of the\nconjecture; that is, for every $k \\geq 2$, there exist a (multi)-set $F\n\\subseteq E(G): |F| \\leq 2k \\nu(G)$ such that each triangle in $G$ overlaps at\nleast $k$ elements in $F$.

Recently, we proposed \\emph{no-trick} (NT) kernel adaptive\nfiltering (KAF) that leverages explicit feature space mappings using\ndata-independent basis with constant complexity. The inner product defined by\nthe feature mapping corresponds to a positive-definite finite-rank kernel that\ninduces a finite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).\nInformation theoretic learning (ITL) is a framework where information theory\ndescriptors based on non-parametric estimator of Renyi entropy replace\nconventional second-order statistics for the design of adaptive systems.

However, most existing quantization\nmethods require access to the original training dataset for retraining during\nquantization.

Existing\nzero-shot quantization methods use different heuristics to address this, but\nthey result in poor performance, especially when quantizing to ultra-low\nprecision. Here, we propose ZeroQ , a novel zero-shot quantization framework to\naddress this. ZeroQ enables mixed-precision quantization without any access to\nthe training or validation data. This is achieved by optimizing for a Distilled\nDataset, which is engineered to match the statistics of batch normalization\nacross different layers of the network. ZeroQ supports both uniform and\nmixed-precision quantization. For the latter, we introduce a novel Pareto\nfrontier based method to automatically determine the mixed-precision bit\nsetting for all layers, with no manual search involved.

Statistical hypothesis testing of\ncovariate-by-treatment interaction is ill-suited for this purpose. The\napplication of decision theory results in treatment rules that compare the\nexpected benefit of treatment given the patient's covariates against a\ntreatment threshold. However, determining treatment threshold is often\ncontext-specific, and any given threshold might seem arbitrary when the overall\ncapacity towards predicting treatment benefit is of concern.

However,\nTDSLs were not previously used for complex use-cases involving long\ntransactions and a variety of data structures.\n  In this paper, we boost the performance and usability of a TDSL, allowing it\nto support complex applications. A key idea is nesting. Nested transactions\ncreate checkpoints within a longer transaction, so as to limit the scope of\nabort, without changing the semantics of the original transaction. We build a\nJava TDSL with built-in support for nesting in a number of data structures.

We also retrieved archival data from the high-resolution long-slit\nspectrograph VLT/X-shooter.\n  Results: We detect the first three bandheads of the $\\upsilon=2-0$ CO\nvibrational emission for the first time in this object.

Despite the recent advances in deep learning based\nclose-talk speech separation, the applications to real-world are still an open\nissue. Two main challenges are the complex acoustic environment and the\nreal-time processing requirement. To address these challenges, we propose a\ntemporal-spatial neural filter, which directly estimates the target speech\nwaveform from multi-speaker mixture in reverberant environments, assisted with\ndirectional information of the speaker(s). Firstly, against variations brought\nby complex environment, the key idea is to increase the acoustic representation\ncompleteness through the jointly modeling of temporal, spectral and spatial\ndiscriminability between the target and interference source. Specifically,\ntemporal, spectral, spatial along with the designed directional features are\nintegrated to create a joint acoustic representation. Secondly, to reduce the\nlatency, we design a fully-convolutional autoencoder framework, which is purely\nend-to-end and single-pass. All the feature computation is implemented by the\nnetwork layers and operations to speed up the separation procedure. Evaluation\nis conducted on simulated reverberant dataset WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix under\nspeaker-independent scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning based multi-channel\napproaches with fewer parameters and faster processing speed.

To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement\nLearning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically\nlearn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs\namong the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem\nsince the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of\nthe others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the\nnetwork.\n  In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized way, where\nSTAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage range, and\nselect the one that better satisfy their needs. To do it, we propose a novel\napproach called Opportunistic epsilon-greedy with Stickiness that halts the\nexploration when a suitable AP is found, only resuming the exploration after\nseveral unsatisfactory association rounds. With this approach, we reduce\nsignificantly the network response dynamics, improving the ability of the STAs\nto find a solution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the\nnetwork resources.\n  We investigate how the characteristics of the scenario (position of the APs\nand STAs, traffic loads, and channel allocation strategies) impact the learning\nprocess and the achievable performance.

Therefore, we suggest circular\nregression trees and random forests as an intuitive alternative approach that\nis relatively easy to fit. Building on previous ideas for trees modeling\ncircular means, we suggest a distributional approach for both trees and forests\nyielding probabilistic forecasts based on the von Mises distribution. The\nresulting tree-based models simplify the estimation process by using the\navailable covariates for partitioning the data into sufficiently homogeneous\nsubgroups so that a simple von Mises distribution without further covariates\ncan be fitted to the circular response in each subgroup.

Combining an ensemble of circular regression trees to a circular\nregression forest yields a local adaptive likelihood estimator for the von\nMises distribution that can regularize and smooth the covariate effects.

Part III of this monograph starts by addressing ways to\nlearn graph topology, from the case where the physics of the problem already\nsuggest a possible topology, through to most general cases where the graph\ntopology is learned from the data. A particular emphasis is on graph topology\ndefinition based on the correlation and precision matrices of the observed\ndata, combined with additional prior knowledge and structural conditions, such\nas the smoothness or sparsity of graph connections. For learning sparse graphs\n(with small number of edges), the least absolute shrinkage and selection\noperator, known as LASSO is employed, along with its graph specific variant,\ngraphical LASSO. For completeness, both variants of LASSO are derived in an\nintuitive way, and explained. An in-depth elaboration of the graph topology\nlearning paradigm is provided through several examples on physically well\ndefined graphs, such as electric circuits, linear heat transfer, social and\ncomputer networks, and spring-mass systems.

This requires however that the precise locations of\nthe Glottal Closure Instants (GCIs) are available. The focus of this paper is\nthe evaluation of automatic methods for the detection of GCIs directly from the\nspeech waveform. Five state-of-the-art GCI detection algorithms are compared\nusing six different databases with contemporaneous electroglottographic\nrecordings as ground truth, and containing many hours of speech by multiple\nspeakers. The five techniques compared are the Hilbert Envelope-based detection\n(HE), the Zero Frequency Resonator-based method (ZFR), the Dynamic Programming\nPhase Slope Algorithm (DYPSA), the Speech Event Detection using the Residual\nExcitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) and the Yet Another GCI Algorithm\n(YAGA). The efficacy of these methods is first evaluated on clean speech, both\nin terms of reliabililty and accuracy. Their robustness to additive noise and\nto reverberation is also assessed. A further contribution of the paper is the\nevaluation of their performance on a concrete application of speech processing:\nthe causal-anticausal decomposition of speech. It is shown that for clean\nspeech, SEDREAMS and YAGA are the best performing techniques, both in terms of\nidentification rate and accuracy.

To investigate the completeness of recorded\nprostate cancer mortality, we compared other-cause (non-prostate cancer)\nmortality in men found and not found to have prostate cancer following a needle\nbiopsy.\n  Methods: We linked Medicare claims data to SEER data to analyze survival in\nthe population of men aged 65+ enrolled in Medicare who resided in a SEER area\nand received a needle biopsy in 1993-2001. We compared other-cause mortality in\nmen found to have prostate cancer (n=53,462) to that in men not found to have\nprostate cancer (n=103,659).\n  Results: The age-race adjusted other-cause mortality rate was 471 per 10,000\nperson-years in men found to have prostate cancer vs. 468 per 10,000 in men not\nfound to have prostate cancer (RR = 1.01;95% CI:0.98-1.03).

As a first\nstep towards a solution, we consider the problem of detecting such data in a\nvalue-based deep reinforcement learning (RL) setting. Modelling this problem as\na one-class classification problem, we propose a framework for\nuncertainty-based OOD classification: UBOOD. It is based on the effect that an\nagent's epistemic uncertainty is reduced for situations encountered during\ntraining (in-distribution), and thus lower than for unencountered (OOD)\nsituations. Being agnostic towards the approach used for estimating epistemic\nuncertainty, combinations with different uncertainty estimation methods, e.g.\napproximate Bayesian inference methods or ensembling techniques are possible.\nWe further present a first viable solution for calculating a dynamic\nclassification threshold, based on the uncertainty distribution of the training\ndata. Evaluation shows that the framework produces reliable classification\nresults when combined with ensemble-based estimators, while the combination\nwith concrete dropout-based estimators fails to reliably detect OOD situations.\nIn summary, UBOOD presents a viable approach for OOD classification in deep RL\nsettings by leveraging the epistemic uncertainty of the agent's value function.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML"], "versions": ["v1"]}

Especially in neuroscience, PSTPM\nis widely used for deep-tissue imaging in the brain. However, due to sequential\nscanning, PSTPM is slow. Temporal focusing microscopy (TFM), on the other hand,\nfocuses femtosecond pulsed laser light temporally, while keeping wide-field\nillumination, and is consequently much faster. However, due to the use of a\ncamera detector, TFM suffers from the scattering of emission photons. As a\nresult, TFM produces images of poor spatial resolution and signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), burying fluorescent signals from small structures such as\ndendritic spines. In this work, we present a data-driven deep learning approach\nto improve resolution and SNR of TFM images. Using a 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) we build a map from TFM to PSTPM modalities, to enable fast TFM\nimaging while maintaining high-resolution through scattering media. We\ndemonstrate this approach for in vivo imaging of dendritic spines on pyramidal\nneurons in the mouse visual cortex. We show that our trained network rapidly\noutputs high-resolution images that recover biologically relevant features\npreviously buried in the scattered fluorescence in the TFM images. In vivo\nimaging that combines TFM and the proposed 3D convolution neural network is one\nto two orders of magnitude faster than PSTPM but retains the high resolution\nand SNR necessary to analyze small fluorescent structures. The proposed 3D\nconvolution deep network could also be potentially beneficial for improving the\nperformance of many speed-demanding deep-tissue imaging applications such as in\nvivo voltage imaging.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["eess.IV physics.optics q-bio.QM"], "versions": ["v1"]}

Resource sharing among different edge cloud-service\nproviders can address the aforementioned limitation as certain service\nproviders may have resources available that can be ``rented'' by other service\nproviders. However, edge cloud service providers can have different objectives\nor \\emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and effective\nmechanism to share resources among service providers, while considering the\ndifferent objectives of various providers.

There are, however, individual SNe that are clearly\ninconsistent with $\\alpha_r=2$. We estimate a mean rise time of 18.5$\\,$d (with\na range extending from $\\sim$15$-$22$\\,$d), though this is subject to the\nadopted prior. We identify an important, previously unknown, bias whereby the\nrise times for higher redshift SNe within a flux-limited survey are\nsystematically underestimated. This effect can be partially alleviated if the\npower-law index is fixed to $\\alpha=2$, in which case we estimate a mean rise\ntime of 21.0$\\,$d (with a range from $\\sim$18$-$23$\\,$d). The sample includes a\nhandful or rare and peculiar SNe Ia. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of\nlessons learned from the ZTF sample that can eventually be applied to Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope observations.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["astro-ph.HE"], "versions": ["v1", "v2"]}

This evolution of bone\ndensity is one of the most important mechanisms for developing fracture\nresistance. A finite element framework for simulating bone adaptation, commonly\ncalled bone remodelling, is presented. This is followed by a novel method to\nboth quantify fracture resistance and to simulate fracture propagation. The\nauthors' previous work on the application of configurational mechanics for\nmodelling fracture is extended to include the influence of heterogeneous bone\ndensity distribution. The main advantage of this approach is that\nconfigurational forces, and fracture energy release rate, are expressed\nexclusively in terms of nodal quantities. This approach avoids the need for\npost-processing and enables a fully implicit formulation for modelling the\nevolving crack front. In this paper density fields are generated from both (a)\nbone adaptation analysis and (b) subject-specific geometry and material\nproperties obtained from CT scans. It is shown that, in order to correctly\nevaluate the configurational forces at the crack front, it is necessary to have\na spatially smooth density field with higher regularity than if the field is\ndirectly approximated on the finite element mesh. Therefore, discrete density\ndata is approximated as a smooth density field using a Moving Weighted Least\nSquares method. Performance of the framework is demonstrated using numerical\nsimulations for bone adaptation and subsequent crack propagation, including\nconsideration of an equine 3rd metacarpal bone.

Visualizing the dynamical movements non-invasively\nallows complex surgical procedures to be performed with less trauma to the\npatient. To improve surgical precision, endovascular procedures can benefit\nfrom more accurate fluoroscopy data via calibration. This paper presents a\nrobust self-calibration algorithm suitable for single-plane and dual-plane\nfluoroscopy. A three-dimensional (3D) target field was imaged by the\nfluoroscope in a strong geometric network configuration. The unknown 3D\npositions of targets and the fluoroscope pose were estimated simultaneously by\nmaximizing the likelihood of the Student-t probability distribution function. A\nsmoothed k-nearest neighbour (kNN) regression is then used to model the\ndeterministic component of the image reprojection error of the robust bundle\nadjustment. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation step and the kNN regression step\nare then repeated iteratively until convergence. Four different error modeling\nschemes were compared while varying the quantity of training images. It was\nfound that using a smoothed kNN regression can automatically model the\nsystematic errors in fluoroscopy with similar accuracy as a human expert using\na small training dataset. When all training images were used, the 3D mapping\nerror was reduced from 0.61-0.83 mm to 0.04 mm post-calibration (94.2-95.7%\nimprovement), and the 2D reprojection error was reduced from 1.17-1.31 to\n0.20-0.21 pixels (83.2-83.8% improvement). When using biplanar fluoroscopy, the\n3D measurement accuracy of the system improved from 0.60 mm to 0.32 mm (47.2%\nimprovement).\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG physics.med-ph"], "versions": ["v1"]}

This\ncriterion may not be met in some cases where time efficiency is required or the\nhardware is insufficient. The problem is especially prominent in large-size\nwhole slide images. This paper focused on the multi-focus image fusion of\ncytopathological digital slide images, and proposed a novel method for\ngenerating fused images from single-focus or few-focus images based on\nconditional generative adversarial network (GAN).

However, we argue their\nbinary decision scheme, i.e., either fully executing or completely bypassing\none layer for a specific input, can be enhanced by introducing finer-grained,\n\"softer\" decisions. We therefore propose a Dynamic Fractional Skipping (DFS)\nframework. The core idea of DFS is to hypothesize layer-wise quantization (to\ndifferent bitwidths) as intermediate \"soft\" choices to be made between fully\nutilizing and skipping a layer. For each input, DFS dynamically assigns a\nbitwidth to both weights and activations of each layer, where fully executing\nand skipping could be viewed as two \"extremes\" (i.e., full bitwidth and zero\nbitwidth). In this way, DFS can \"fractionally\" exploit a layer's expressive\npower during input-adaptive inference, enabling finer-grained\naccuracy-computational cost trade-offs. It presents a unified view to link\ninput-adaptive layer skipping and input-adaptive hybrid quantization. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior tradeoff between computational\ncost and model expressive power (accuracy) achieved by DFS. More visualizations\nalso indicate a smooth and consistent transition in the DFS behaviors,\nespecially the learned choices between layer skipping and different\nquantizations when the total computational budgets vary, validating our\nhypothesis that layer quantization could be viewed as intermediate variants of\nlayer skipping.

Based on the knowledge of the liquid state theory, the self-energy\nspecified in this study not only relates a direct correlation function to the\nGaussian smearing of each charged sphere, but also provides the electrostatic\ncontribution to solvation free energy that shows good agreement with simulation\nresults. Furthermore, the Ornstein-Zernike equation leads to a new set of\ngeneralized Debye-H\\\"uckel equations reflecting the Gaussian distributed\ncharges.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph physics.plasm-ph"], "versions": ["v1"]}

In colloidal science, where the prime\ngoal is to develop colloidal particles that mimic and exceed the diversity and\nlength-scales of atomic and molecular assembly, electrostatically charged\nparticles cannot change the sign of their surface charge or transform from\nmonopoles to higher-order multipoles. In liquid-crystal colloids, elastic\ninteractions between particles arise to minimize the free energy associated\nwith elastic distortions in the long-range alignment of rod-like molecules\naround the particles.

By separating the\ncontributions of vacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction, we first\nshow that for the two-atom system initially prepared in the factorizable\neigenstates $|g_Ag_B\\rangle$ and $|e_Ae_B\\rangle$, where $g$ and $e$ represent\nthe ground state and the excited state of a single atom respectively, both\nvacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction contribute to the average\nrate of change of energy of the two-atom system, and the contribution of vacuum\nfluctuations is independent of the interatomic separation while that of atomic\nradiation reaction is dependent on it. This is contrary to the existing results\nin the literature where vacuum fluctuations are interatomic-separation\ndependent. However, if the two-atom system is initially prepared in the\nunfactorizable symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, the average rate of\nchange of energy of the two-atom system is never perturbed by the vacuum\nfluctuations, but is totally a result of the atomic radiation reaction. We then\nconsider two special cases of motion of the two-atom system which is initially\nprepared in the symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, i.e., synchronized\ninertial motion and synchronized uniform acceleration. In contrast to the\naverage rate of change of energy of a single uniformly accelerated atom, the\naverage rate of change of energy of the uniformly accelerated two-atom system\nis nonthermal-like.

The activation function was\ngenerated by synthetic genetic circuits, and for each artificial neuron, the\nweight and bias values were adjusted manually by engineering the molecular\ninteractions within the bacterial neuron to represent a specific logical\nfunction. The artificial bacterial neurons were connected as ANN architectures\nto implement a 2-to-4 chemical decoder and a 1-to-2 chemical de-multiplexer. To\nour knowledge, this is the first ANN created by artificial bacterial neurons.\nThus, it may open up a new direction in ANN research, where engineered\nbiological cells can be used as ANN enabled hardware.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["physics.bio-ph cs.ET q-bio.MN"], "versions": ["v1"]}

Compared with the traditional SAV/IEQ\napproaches, there are many advantages for the novel 3S-SAV/3S-IEQ schemes.\nFirstly, we do not need the restriction of the bounded from below of the\nnonlinear free energy potential/density function. Secondly, the auxiliary\nvariable combined with nonlinear function can be treated totally explicitly in\nthe 3S-SAV/3S-IEQ approaches. Specially, for solving the discrete scheme based\non IEQ approach, the linear system usually involves variable coefficients which\nchange at each time step. However, the discrete scheme based on 3S-IEQ approach\nleads to linear equation with constant coefficients. Two comparative studies of\ntraditional SAV/IEQ and 3S-SAV/3S-IEQ approaches are considered to show the\naccuracy and efficiency. Finally, we present various 2D numerical simulations\nto demonstrate the stability and accuracy.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["math.NA cs.NA math.AP"], "versions": ["v1"]}

In this work, we propose a novel re-synchronization\nprocedure for multi-modal fusion, which aligns the hand features with lips\nfeature. It is realized by delaying hand position and hand shape with their\noptimal hand preceding time which is derived by investigating the temporal\norganizations of hand position and hand shape movements in CS. This\nre-synchronization procedure is incorporated into a practical continuous CS\nrecognition system that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) with\nmulti-stream hidden markov model (MSHMM).

In TOP,\neach location can be visited by at most one vehicle, and the goal is to\nmaximize the total sum of rewards collected by the vehicles within a given time\nlimit. In this paper, we propose a generalization of TOP, namely the Steiner\nTeam Orienteering Problem (STOP). In STOP, we provide, additionally, a subset\nof mandatory locations. In this sense, STOP also aims at maximizing the total\nsum of rewards collected within the time limit, but, now, every mandatory\nlocation must be visited. In this work, we propose a new commodity-based\nformulation for STOP and use it within a cutting-plane scheme. The algorithm\nbenefits from the compactness and strength of the proposed formulation and\nworks by separating three families of valid inequalities, which consist of some\ngeneral connectivity constraints, classical lifted cover inequalities based on\ndual bounds and a class of conflict cuts. To our knowledge, the last class of\ninequalities is also introduced in this work. A state-of-the-art branch-and-cut\nalgorithm from the literature of TOP is adapted to STOP and used as baseline to\nevaluate the performance of the cutting-plane. Extensive computational\nexperiments show the competitiveness of the new algorithm while solving several\nSTOP and TOP instances. In particular, it is able to solve, in total, 14 more\nTOP instances than any other previous exact algorithm and finds eight new\noptimality certificates. With respect to the new STOP instances introduced in\nthis work, our algorithm solves 30 more instances than the baseline.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["cs.DS"], "versions": ["v1"]}

All singly periodic domains may be\nclassified into three distinct types: unbounded in two directions, unbounded in\none direction, and bounded. In each case, we relate the target periodic domain\nto a canonical circular domain via conformal mapping and present the functional\nform of prototypical conformal maps for each type of target domain. We then\npresent solutions for a range of potential flow phenomena including flow\nsingularities, moving boundaries, uniform flows, straining flows and\ncirculatory flows. By phrasing the solutions in terms of the transcendental\nSchottky--Klein prime function, the ensuing solutions are valid for an\narbitrary number of obstacles per period window.

It is associated with energy release\nin regions of magnetic field annihilation, but this is only one facet of this\nprocess. Astrophysical flows normally have very large Reynolds numbers and are\nexpected to be turbulent, in agreement with observations. In strong turbulence\nmagnetic lines constantly reconnect everywhere at all scales, making magnetic\nreconnection an intrinsic part of turbulent cascade. We note that this is\ninconsistent with the usual practice of regarding magnetic lines as persistent\ndynamical elements. A number of theoretical, numerical, and observational\nstudies, starting with Lazarian & Vishniac (1999), demonstrated that 3D\nturbulence makes magnetic reconnection fast and that these two processes are\nintrinsically connected. We discuss the dramatic violation of the textbook\nconcept of magnetic flux-freezing in the presence of turbulence and demonstrate\nthat in the presence of turbulence the plasma effects are subdominant to\nturbulence as far as the magnetic reconnection is concerned. This justifies an\nMHD-like treatment of magnetic reconnection at scales much larger than the\nrelevant plasma scales. We discuss numerical and observational evidences\nsupporting the turbulent reconnection model. In particular, we show that\ntearing reconnection is suppressed in 3D and, unlike the 2D case, the 3D\nreconnection induces turbulence that makes reconnection independent of\nresistivity. We show that turbulent reconnection dramatically affects the key\nastrophysical processes, e.g., star formation, turbulent dynamo, acceleration\nof cosmic rays. We provide criticism of the concept of \"reconnection-mediated\nturbulence\" and explain why turbulent reconnection is very different from\nenhanced turbulent resistivity and hyper-resistivity, and why the latter has\nfatal conceptual flaws.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["astro-ph.HE physics.comp-ph physics.plasm-ph"], "versions": ["v1"]}

The machining and assembly tolerances for\ncommercially available optical systems cause a slight misalignment (tilt)\nbetween the lens and CCD, resulting in PSF degradation. We have built an\nautomated alignment system (Robotilters) to solve this challenge, optimizing 4\ndegrees of freedom - 2 tilt axes, a separation axis (the distance between the\nCCD and lens), and the lens focus (the built-in focus of the lens by turning\nthe lens focusing ring which moves the optical elements relative to one\nanother) in a compact and low-cost package. The Robotilters remove tilt and\noptimize focus at the sub 10 micron level, are completely automated, take 2\nhours to run, and remain stable for multiple years once aligned. The\nRobotilters were built for the Evryscope telescope (a 780 MPix 22-camera array\nwith an 8150 sq.deg. field of view and continuous 2-minute cadence) designed to\ndetect short timescale events across extremely large sky areas simultaneously.\nVariance in quality across the image field, especially the corners and edges\ncompared to the center, is a significant challenge in wide-field astronomical\nsurveys like the Evryscope. The individual star PSFs (which typically extend\nonly a few pixels) are highly susceptible to slight increases in optical\naberrations in this situation. The Robotilter solution resulted in a limiting\nmagnitude improvement of .5 mag in the center of the image and 1.0 mag in the\ncorners for typical Evryscope cameras, with less distorted and smaller PSFs\n(half the extent in the corners and edges in many cases).

Nonlinear regression models of\nNelson-Siegel and Svensson were used to estimate the yield curve using a sample\nof historical data supplied by the National Stock Exchange of Costa Rica. The\noptimization problem involved in the estimation process of model parameters is\naddressed by the use of four well known combinatorial optimization\nmetaheuristics: Ant colony optimization, Genetic algorithm, Particle swarm\noptimization and Simulated annealing. The aim of the study is to improve the\nlocal minima obtained by a classical quasi-Newton optimization method using a\ndescent direction. Good results with at least two metaheuristics are achieved,\nParticle swarm optimization and Simulated annealing.

However, these\nresults do not apply to architectures that require one or more of the hidden\nlayers to remain narrow. In this paper, we consider the wide limit of BNNs\nwhere some hidden layers, called \"bottlenecks\", are held at finite width. The\nresult is a composition of GPs that we term a \"bottleneck neural network\nGaussian process\" (bottleneck NNGP). Although intuitive, the subtlety of the\nproof is in showing that the wide limit of a composition of networks is in fact\nthe composition of the limiting GPs. We also analyze theoretically a\nsingle-bottleneck NNGP, finding that the bottleneck induces dependence between\nthe outputs of a multi-output network that persists through extreme\npost-bottleneck depths, and prevents the kernel of the network from losing\ndiscriminative power at extreme post-bottleneck depths.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["stat.ML cs.LG"], "versions": ["v1", "v2"]}

We show that such a\nmeasurement is nevertheless possible in the energy band 10-100 TeV. The minimal\ncharged particle background for IACTs is achieved in event selections used for\nthe analyses of the cosmic ray electrons. Tight cuts on the event quality in\nthese event selections allow to achieve the background level sufficiently low\nto allow the measurements of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray flux above 10 TeV.\nWe calculate the sensitivities of different types of IACT arrays for the\nGalactic diffuse emission measurements and compare them with the diffuse\ngamma-ray flux from different parts of the sky measured by the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope below 3 TeV and with the astrophysical neutrino signal measured by\nIceCube telescope. We show that deep exposure of existing IACT systems is\nsufficient for detection of the diffuse flux from all the Galactic Plane up to\nGalactic latitude |b|~ degrees. Medium Size Telescope array of CTA will be able\nto detect the diffuse flux up 30 degree Galactic latitude. Its sensitivity will\nbe sufficient for detection of the gamma-ray counterpart of the Galactic\ncomponent of the IceCube astrophysical neutrino signal above 10 TeV.

Because thin films adopt structures and chemistries\ndistinct from their bulk counterparts, it is often difficult to predict what\nproperties will emerge.

In this paper, we study the\ncold atomic component of the giant molecular filament GMF38a (d=3.4 kpc,\nlength$\\sim230$ pc).

The peak velocities of the HISA and 13CO\nobservations agree well on the eastern side of the filament, whereas a velocity\noffset of approximately 4 km s$^{-1}$ is found on the western side. The sonic\nMach number we derive from the linewidth measurements shows that a large\nfraction of the HISA, which is ascribed to the cold neutral medium (CNM), is at\nsubsonic and transonic velocities. The column density of the CNM is on the\norder of 10$^{20}$ to 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column density of molecular\nhydrogen is an order of magnitude higher. The N-PDFs from HISA (CNM), HI\nemission (WNM+CNM), and 13CO (molecular component) are well described by\nlog-normal functions, which is in agreement with turbulent motions being the\nmain driver of cloud dynamics. The N-PDF of the molecular component also shows\na power law in the high column-density region, indicating self-gravity. We\nsuggest that we are witnessing two different evolutionary stages within the\nfilament.

These combinations of space\nand time are natural sources for well-behaved implications and we will show\nthat their spatio-temporal implications represent any other reasonable abstract\nimplication. Then to provide a faithful well-behaved syntax for abstract\nimplications, we will develop a logical system for the non-commutative\nspacetimes for which we will present both topological and Kripke semantics.\nThese logics unify sub-structural and sub-intuionistic logics by embracing them\nas their special fragments.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["math.LO"], "versions": ["v1"]}

This manuscript\npresents a Deterministic plus Stochastic Model (DSM) of the residual signal.\nThe DSM consists of two contributions acting in two distinct spectral bands\ndelimited by a maximum voiced frequency. Both components are extracted from an\nanalysis performed on a speaker-dependent dataset of pitch-synchronous residual\nframes. The deterministic part models the low-frequency contents and arises\nfrom an orthonormal decomposition of these frames. As for the stochastic\ncomponent, it is a high-frequency noise modulated both in time and frequency.\nSome interesting phonetic and computational properties of the DSM are also\nhighlighted. The applicability of the DSM in two fields of speech processing is\nthen studied. First, it is shown that incorporating the DSM vocoder in\nHMM-based speech synthesis enhances the delivered quality. The proposed\napproach turns out to significantly outperform the traditional pulse excitation\nand provides a quality equivalent to STRAIGHT. In a second application, the\npotential of glottal signatures derived from the proposed DSM is investigated\nfor speaker identification purpose. Interestingly, these signatures are shown\nto lead to better recognition rates than other glottal-based methods.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["cs.SD cs.CL eess.AS"], "versions": ["v1"]}
